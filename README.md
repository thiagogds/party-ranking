Meteor app to rank people at Facebook events.

# How to run

* Install [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)
* Install [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite)
* Run `mrt`

Meteorite will download and configure everything to run meteor.

Instead of use `meteor` commands you have to use `mrt`, like `mrt reset` instead of `meteor reset`

Meteorite let you add packages from [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/) using `mrt add *package*`
